ðŸ”¹ Theory

When a user forgets their password:
	1.	Forgot Password Request
	â€¢	User enters their email.
	â€¢	Backend checks if the email exists.
	â€¢	Generates a secure random token (short-lived, e.g., 15 mins).
	â€¢	Saves it in the database (hashed) with an expiry time.
	â€¢	Sends a reset password link via email containing the token.

	2.	Reset Password Page
	â€¢	User clicks link (e.g., https://example.com/reset-password/:token).
	â€¢	Frontend asks them to set a new password.
	â€¢	Backend verifies token & expiry, then updates the password.
  
	3.	Security
	â€¢	Token should be single-use.
	â€¢	Should expire quickly.
	â€¢	Store token hashed (never plain text).
	â€¢	Always hash the new password before saving.
